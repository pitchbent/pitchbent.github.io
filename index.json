I am able to flash the processors and make the onboard LEDs blink.\nThis project will keep me busy for some time, because I want to use it for small IoT projects (home automation) like an irrigation system for my many, many plants.\nSchematics      The processor I used is an STM32F103C8T6 as well as an ESP8266-WROOM. Most of the schematics is taken from app notes from ST or Espressif. The two processors are connected via UART.\n   Power is regulated with an linear regulator, which brings 5V down to 3.3V.\nAdditionally there are some built in LEDs. One for power monitoring and one for each microcontroller as status LED.\nThe buttons are necessary for programming the chips. All the STM32 pins are broken out to the side, where pin headers can be soldered in.\nLayout    The Layout, as well as the Schematics were done in Altium. It is a simple two layer layout with components only on the top side. The bottom layer features a big grounded copper pour.\nThe crystal oscillator features a guard ring.\nAssembly The PCB was ordered from JLC PCB because their prices can\u0026rsquo;t compete with the prices from european fabs. Parts were ordered from LCSC because they mostly are much cheaper than Digikey or Mouser.\nI hand soldered the board. It was quite easy, because of the low part count and because no \u0026ldquo;crazy\u0026rdquo; footprints were used.\nProgramming Not much to say about this right now, because I did not find much time to care about this. I was able to flash the chips tho, but only made the LEDs blink. More to come!\nUpdate: There is, at least, a pinout now:\n   ","date":1600792340,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600792340,"objectID":"e4ea2f41d3de29021dcfcd2b00b0dc3f","permalink":"https://example.com/project/esp32vsstm32/","publishdate":"2020-09-22T18:32:20+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/esp32vsstm32/","section":"project","summary":"This project is all about making an ESP talk with an STM32 and vice versa","tags":["Microcontroller"],"title":"ESP8266 vs STM32","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Eurorack"],"content":"In this little blog post I will describe how I built a small rack by myself. The size is 19inch/68HP with a standard height of 3U. There are two rows.\nCase The case is made of plywood, with a depth of 20.5cm - this more than enough for large modules and the power supplies in the back.\nPower    I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother with linear power supplies because switching supplies were a lot cheaper, with good specs. I used Meanwell supplies. I am thinking about building a power supply by myself, with switching supplies as \u0026ldquo;core\u0026rdquo; and linear regulators as output stage to smoothen the ripple - but not any time soon.\nThe supplies I used feature +-12V as well as 5V rail. I designed and 3D-printed a brace to screw the 5V supply to the backside of the case, the 12V supplies were mounted using the built in holes.\nPower distribution was realized by using stripboard and regular eurorack headers.\nThe port for the AC-Mains cable features a fuse for additional security.\n","date":1600692218,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600692218,"objectID":"636a6303483a50b9cd0d18fe033e2468","permalink":"https://example.com/post/rack/","publishdate":"2020-09-21T14:43:38+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/rack/","section":"post","summary":"Quick explanation of my case","tags":["Eurorack"],"title":"Rack","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Eurorack"],"content":"Finally, it is coming to an end. What started a few months back is finally taking shape. The first four modules are about to be finished.\nThe only parts still missing are the jacks as well as the potentiometers and the SSM2164 chip for the filter. I will order those parts from Thonk, because there is no cheap alternative distributor available which sells directly from china.\nTesting is not done yet as well, because my beloved makerspace Raumzeitlabor is currently moving and because of this I do not have access to proper testing equipment.\nI am building the following four modules, which will form a nice drum voice when my VCA is finished:\nKrach aus Strom    This will be the main part of the drum voice. It\u0026rsquo;s only missing mechanical parts.\nDual ADSR    The name already shows what this module is about - a dual ADSR with fancy faders, which light up according to the triggered stage. It is missing the mechanical parts as well.\nWavelet    This is the Plum Audio edition of the Mutable Instruments Ripples. It is a filter with a 12dB or 24dB low pass or a 12dB band pass which also has an internal VCA. It is missing the mechanical parts and the SSM2164 chip.\nmBrane    This module will be my MIDI to CV bridge. It is based on the Mutable Instruments Yarns. It is obviously missing the mechanical parts. I did not solder the STM32, the DAC and the optocoupler yet, because I want to test the power rails first.\n","date":1600672610,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600672610,"objectID":"794addb7908ee5e002f8c5bbc2f37775","permalink":"https://example.com/post/almost-finished-pcbs/","publishdate":"2020-09-21T09:16:50+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/almost-finished-pcbs/","section":"post","summary":"A quick update on my progress","tags":["Eurorack"],"title":"Almost Finished PCBs","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Hello World Welcome Welcome to my humble blog.
